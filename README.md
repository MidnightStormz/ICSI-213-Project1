Code creates an empty bag and populates the bag with items from a .txt file. Then the array can be manipulated.

The problems I am running into is whenever I input the items from the text file they dont read into an array. I am trying to get a get method setup to return a value at a given index and the program is not returning anything. I cannot figure out how to create one array and then implement the items from the file into the array to then manipulate the array using other methods.
